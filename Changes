Revision history for uniname-words

{{$NEXT}}

10.0.4  2021-11-28T12:00:28+01:00
    - Make sure that codepoints that have the same word in their
      name more than once, are only listed once (like 0x1FB3C,
      LOWER LEFT BLOCK DIAGONAL LOWER MIDDLE LEFT TO LOWER CENTRE)
    - Add handling of parameters to the uniname-words sub, to find
      words, or strings, either all or any
    - Add a command line utility "uw" to easily access the added
      functionality

10.0.3  2021-11-07T12:04:31+01:00
    - Remove the module specification, we don't need it anymore

10.0.2  2021-10-14T13:00:21+02:00
    - Oops, forgot to manually update META :-(

10.0.1  2021-10-14T11:23:35+02:00
    - Bundle all reserved codepoints under "reserved" without
      checking the rest of the name.  This reduces the number
      of entries from 1092494 to 262166, and also reduces the
      compile time of the module from 30+ seconds to around 6
      seconds on the computer of yours truly.  gfldex++ for
      the impetus to look into this.

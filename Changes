    - Bundle all reserved codepoints under "reserved" without
      checking the rest of the name.  This reduces the number
      of entries from 1092494 to 262166, and also reduces the
      compile time of the module from 30+ seconds to around 6
      seconds on the computer of yours truly.  gfldex++ for
      the impetus to look into this.
